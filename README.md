## Project Highlights
###### PD: In all the projects I have participated as full stack developer or project leader. Some projects are here in github, others in bitbuckets and other repositories, additionally most of them you can't see the code due to privacy clauses. In some I will leave the url of access, in others not because they are internal platforms.
